Pitchfork Scraping
==================
Pitchfork is a popular music website that publishes reviews, news, and exclusive content daily. It's a pretty good source if you're able to ignore the occasional snarkiness. In August, 2015, Pitchfork released a list of their top 200 songs from the 1980's. Those synthy, poppy, and at times unbearably catchy tunes have always been a guilty pleasure of mine (now the secrets out) so I'm interesed in aggregating all these tracks into a simple user-friendly list. 
I could probably do this pretty quickly with the Python library Beautiful Soup, but I'm learning Golang so I'll try out their html package to do this.
